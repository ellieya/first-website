            <p>It's a good thing this project is so lenient in terms of content<s>, because all of the content on this page was written from midnight to 3AM.</s> It's difficult for me to come up with things to talk about myself. So, uhm...expect pointless rambling & tangents. The text on this website is pretty worthless, it might as  well be lorem ipsum.</p>
            
            <p>So what is the significance of the image on the right side of this page? There is none. I just so happened to be watching Jojo, and I told my friend it would look nice for a background image and he agreed, so yeah...</p>
            
            <p>Er, well it isn't a background image in this instance. That's because I wanted a dark theme. So it's a side image! </p>
                
            <p>What was I thinking when I came up with this color scheme? Hmm, well, I played MapleStory2 a long time ago, and many people were walking around with hairs using purple/pink w/ cyan gradients. At first I was like, "pffffffft, overrated," but you know, it is pretty attractive.</p>
            
            <p>Playspan used similar colors, if I recall correctly. I don't know how many of you played MMORPG back when Grand Chase/MapleStory <i style="color:gray;">(RIP Grand Chase)</i> ruled over F2P MMORPG, but Playspan were the guys who made Ultimate Game Card. Yeah, I have no idea what they're doing nowathesedays. <s>I think they're bankrupt? I have no idea how that would happen, though.</s> Oh, Visa bought them out. Well, good for them. </p>
            
            <p>The general layout...well, I don't really like it. The reason for this is because it looks a bit like a typical tumblr design. <i style="color:gray;">(I have horrible memories about that site...)</i> I'd rather have a more dynamic website, but my progress on learning JavaScript isn't going very well. Though, I suppose nobody can actually learn enough JavaScript to do what I want to do in 3 days.</p>
            
            <p>Unless they pulled 3 all-nighters in a row, I guess. But then how would you concentrate? Well, I suppose a genius could do it.</p>
            
            <p>Anyways, to sum it up, this project is nowhere close to the maximum of my current capabilities. For future reference, I will focus more on content before structure on the website, and build it around that, rather than the other way around.</p>
            
            <h1 id="h2">Current Goals</h1>
            <h2>Short Term</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Full understanding of JavaScript would be nice</li>
                <li>~700 FICO Credit Score, so I can go buck wild and waste my credit card inquiry limit for the next 2 years</li>
                <ul>
                <li>I really want this:<br>
                    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/l4xYROM.png">
                </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Associates in Computer Science</li>
                <li>8 hours of sleep everyday</li>
                <li>Lunch, breakfast, & dinner everyday</li>
            </ul>            
            
            <h2>Long Term</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Excellent credit</li>
                <ul>
                    <li> and this:<br>
                    <img width="240px" src="https://www.citi.com/CRD/images/card_no_reflection/citi-double-cash-credit-card.jpg">
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>A job that pays $50/hour so I can buy someone/myself a fancy steak dinner everyday if I wanted to...</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I probably have more goals, but I can't think of them right now.</p>
            
            <h1 id="h3">Hobbies</h1>
            
            <p>I have barely anything I am dedicated to, and when I am dedicated to something, it's a large burst, and then I don't care anymore. For example, I returned to MapleStory, played it for 23 hours in a row, then played for around 63 hours total after only 3 days, and then I completely stopped playing it.</p>
            
            <p>Yeah...</p>
            
            <p>I absolutely love NVMe SSDs though.</p>
            
            <div id="img-container">

                <img src="img/nvmebench.png">   
            </div>
            
            <p>Just look at that beauty!</p>
            
            <p>I NEED one in my life, man. But I'd have to buy a new mobo, and with a new mobo, I'd need a new CPU, and CPUs are expensive, and my current CPU has already dropped in market value, not to mention it's locked, so you can't unclock it unless you have a special mobo, so at best I can sell it for like $100 if I'm really lucky...</p>
            
            <p>
            Anyways, here's a list of stuff. Bullet lists are good for filler.</p>
            
            <h2>Currently Watching</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I wish I watched it when it came out, this is such a gem. Like, the story isn't that great, but the comedy has great timing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>My goldfish swim around</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>He's a cutie patootie.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Currently Playing</h2>
            <p style="font-size:0.5em">Or so I say but the reality is that I have no time for playing any games... *sobsob*</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Divinity Original Sin 2</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It cost $45, friend bought it for me if I promised to play it with him, unfortunately I haven't had much time to do so.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Story of Seasons</li>
                <li>Still haven't completed Pokedex on S/M</li>

            <h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Finding good & cheap eats</li>
                <li>Spending hours on research and then realizing it's 3AM and I should've slept 5 hours ago</li>
                <li>Making excel spreadsheets to help organize my life, then proceed to forget I made them 2 weeks afterwards</li>
            </ul>
